Qualys has extensive data of hosts and vulnerabilities detected on them, and this integration helps you bring it to Atlassian Jira to create actionable SecOps tickets. This pull-based integration downloads the detection data and automatically creates or resolves tickets based on status of each detection. Qualys Integration with Atlassian Jira allows customers to create customized rules for creating actionable tickets in desired projects assigned to the desired owner. This also enables users to build Jira filters, reporting dashboards natively in Jira using JQL capabilities to simplify the operationalization.
